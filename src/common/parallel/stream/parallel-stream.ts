 * onNext handler that is called with the result of every spawned task. This allows to stream to the
 * task results and using intermediate results until all tasks have completed.
 *
 * Catch can be used to register to task failures. Without a catch handler, task failures are silently ignored.
 * The stream implements a fast fail interface. If any task fail, all other tasks are canceled.
 * @param TSubResult the results produced by a single task that needs to be joined to the end result
 * @param TEndResult the joined result of all tasks.
